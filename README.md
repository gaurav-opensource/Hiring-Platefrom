# Hiring Project

I developed a full-stack **Hiring Platform** where students can directly connect with companies and apply for jobs.
The system manages the **entire recruitment workflow** â€” from job posting to resume evaluation, coding tests, and interviews.
It integrates **ML models** for resume scoring and test evaluation, and also includes a built-in **online code editor**.

## About the Project

The **Hiring Project** is a full-stack recruitment system designed to connect students and recruiters.
It simplifies the hiring process by providing:

* Job posting by HR
* Student applications with resumes
* Automated resume scoring (ML)
* Online test system with real-time code editor
* Test evaluation using ML
* Candidate shortlisting for interviews

This project demonstrates **end-to-end recruitment automation** with both web development and AI/ML integration.

## Project Flow

### Student Flow

* Register and create a profile (upload resume, personal info).
* View all job postings.
* Apply to jobs (resume automatically submitted).
* Get notifications about tests and interviews.
* Solve coding tests using the **built-in code editor**.
* Progress through recruitment stages.

### HR Flow

* Register and create HR profile.
* Post new jobs.
* View all applicants for each job.
* Stage 1: Resume Scoring (ML model ranks students).
* Stage 2: Shortlist top students.
* Stage 3: Send coding tests via email link.
* Stage 4: Evaluate test scores (ML + Judge0).
* Stage 5: Select candidates for interview.
